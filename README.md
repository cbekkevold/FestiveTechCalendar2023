Scripts for Christmas Cleaning in Entra ID, hope this helps you keep Entra ID clean! ðŸ§¹

If you're not familiar with Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, you can read more about it here: [Getting started with Microsoft PowerShell Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/get-started?view=graph-powershell-1.0)

And if you have old scripts using the Azure AD or MSOnline modules you can easily convert them to Microsoft Graph PowerShell, using this cmdlet mapping list: [Cmdlet Mapping List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/azuread-msoline-cmdlet-map?view=graph-powershell-1.0)

If you don't allready have the module installed, you can use these to get both  the production and beta modules:

```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph

Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta
```

## Scripts in this repository

You can run all scripts by default, no changes needed if you accept my conditions.
Scopes are set for every script, but you might need to have administrator role(s) too.

### GetApplicationInformation.ps1

This script is built on Microsofts own example: [Export app registrations with expiring secrets and certificates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/scripts/powershell-export-apps-with-expiring-secrets)
But i wanted more information, so i have rewrited it to fit my needs. And you can also use this information to maybe clean up som old applications that are not used anymore, or not working because of expired secrets/certificates. My default is to check for secrets or certificates that expire within the next 60 days, but you can change this to whatever you want.
